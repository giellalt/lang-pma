# Noun inflection
So far only px suffixes have been added.
The nouns are divided by alienability, but so far both 
noun types point to the same **px** lexicon.

LEXICON Cases is a dummy lexicon.

LEXICON inal is for inalienable nouns (head, hand, ...)

LEXICON al is for alienable nouns (all other words)

LEXICON px gives the suffixes from the Wikipedia article.
